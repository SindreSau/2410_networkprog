Traceroute returns a list of hops between the source and the destination, along with
the round trip time (RTT) for each destination for three packets.

To achieve this, the host starts by sending a packet with a TTL of 1, which will
expire at the first hop. The first hop will then return an ICMP message to the host,
indicating that the TTL has expired. The host will then send a packet with a TTL of 2,
which will expire at the second hop, and so on.

The first hop is denoted as _gateway, and refers to my router. The RTT for this 
hop is minimal, as the router is pysically close.

The second hop is the first step outside my local network, which in my case is my 
ISP. The following hops are all within the ISP's network.
