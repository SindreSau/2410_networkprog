# Socket programming

### Following the tutorial by Tech With Tim

I am currently following a tutorial by Tech With Tim on socket programming. The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on how to build socket-based applications using Python.

You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QiPPX-KeSc&ab_channel=TechWithTim). It covers various topics such as creating a server, establishing client-server communication, handling multiple clients, and more.

Socket programming is a fundamental concept in network programming, and this tutorial has been a great resource for learning and understanding the basics of socket programming.

I highly recommend checking out the tutorial if you're interested in learning more about socket programming in Python.
